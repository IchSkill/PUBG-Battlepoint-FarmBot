I fixed the "Game still in progress" and If you die it clicks the return to lobby
all you have to do is put the resolution of the coords of the "cancel"
the 1080 coords are already put it in the file input.txt (The coords have to be like first one (space) second one), 1080 =" 1021 626 " (Without "" obviously)
and you also have to put ur coords to skip to lobby, in the 2nd line the 1080 coords are 1721 960
