MAke sure you change your montior resolution to match whatever resolution you pick in the bot, otherwise it wont work correctly.


Turn off any color corrections like reshade before using the bot otherwise it will not work. 

The quit button finally works now lol



Directions: 

Make sure the game isnt open.

1.Open the bot (it takes a few seconds to load)
2. Choose your resolution 
3. hit start
4. The bot will open the game. Wait for the game to load and the bot wiill auto start working. (Dont worry if the bot ui freezes up, thats normal. )

MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING FULLSCREEN WINDOWED WITH RESHADE TURNED OFF




NEED HELP? Looking for updates?

If you run into any errors, find the bot not working correctly, or not running: 

* Check the help tab in the bot
* if that doesnt help check the faq in discord to recieve help/updates
* if the bot is crashing, open cmd or powershell first, then run python botgui.py and let me know what error you got 


TURN OFF WALLPAPER ENGINE:

it conflicts with this bot and will cause it to not work correctly
