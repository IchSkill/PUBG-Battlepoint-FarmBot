This bot will: 

*  auto jump at a random point on the plane between 40-70 seconds after the plane appears. 

* auto hold down the space bar just in case you land in water and end up underwater 

* It will also lay down after running and jumping. 

* I added a few more configs to the bot so it supports 2560x 1440p and 2560 x1080p. I dont have the last resolution so it might not work well for 2560 x 1080p.

In that case you will need to run your monitor at one of the other three supported resolutions. 

Turn off any color corrections like reshade before using the bot otherwise it will not work. 



Directions: 

Make sure the game isnt open.

1.Open the bot (it takes a few seconds to load)
2. Choose your resolution 
3. hit start
4. The bot will open the game. Wait for the game to load and the bot wiill auto start working. (Dont worry if the bot ui freezes up, thats normal. )

MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING FULLSCREEN WINDOWED WITH RESHADE TURNED OFF

NEED HELP? Looking for updates?

If you run into any errors, find the bot not working correctly, or not running: 

* Check the help tab in the bot
* if that doesnt help check the discord to recieve help/updates
* 720p might not work all of the way, its on the list of things to test

BOT FAILED TO OPEN:
* BotGUI failed to open error : Make sure the debug file is present, if it has no number inside put in the number 1.  The debug file is located in the lib folder. lib\debug.txt 

TURN OFF WALLPAPER ENGINE:

it conflicts with this bot and will cause it to not work correctly

I fixed the "Game still in progress" and If you die it clicks the return to lobby
all you have to do is put the resolution of the coords of the "cancel"
the 1080 coords are already put it in the file input.txt (The coords have to be like first one (space) second one), 1080 =" 1021 626 " (Without "" obviously)
and you also have to put ur coords to skip to lobby, in the 2nd line the 1080 coords are 1721 960

I will make more updates if is need it and Cloxen (the developer) dont want or dont have time.
You can follow me in twitter where I will put the updates.

I consider that this version could be the v2.2, that is updated to the pubg 22-01-2018 version
